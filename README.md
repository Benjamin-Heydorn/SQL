# Overview

In this project I learned about and practiced using an SQL database table. I store information input about a car and provide a menu to modify or delete this information.

When the program starts, it will open or generate a records.db file in the current directory and store SQL table information in it that saves upon running commands in the program.

The purpose of this project was to learn about SQL.

# Relational Database

The database contains one table with information on cars.

The columns of this table are the make, model, year, license plate state, license plate number, color, and last updated timestamp of the entry.

# Development Environment

This was developed using Visual Studio Code. 

Python and the SQLite3 library were used to interact with the database.

# Useful Websites

* [SQLite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)

# Future Work

* Clean up and organize the code
* Make a design with multiple tables
